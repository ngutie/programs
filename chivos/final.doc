When trying to implement the javafx i had problems getting it to show using visual code but when debugging it showed no errors and compiled but i also ran the prgram before the java fx was ran and it ran smoothly and showed the classes worked as intended

UML:
Chivos public


Chivos()
getschedule(EmployeeID: int)
setschedule(EmployeeID:int, managerID: int)
request(EmployeeID:int, ManagersID:int)


Employee public 
-firstname: string
-lastname: string
-wage: double
-employeeID: int
Employee()
Employee(employeeID: int)
makerequest(EmployeeID)


Manager public
-firstname: string
-lastname: string
-wage: double
-managerID: int
manager()
Manager(managerID: int)
checkrequest(EmployeeID:int)
newEmployee(firstname: string, lastname: string, wage: double, employeeID: int)
newManager(firstname: string, lastname: string, wage: double, managerID: int)


WeeklySchedule private


weeklyschedule: array
schedule(employeeID: int, managerID: int)
